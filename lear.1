.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lear
is a humorous CLI tool in the spirit of
.BR sl (1).
When you mistype
.B clear
as
.BR lear ,
it streams the full text of Shakespeare's
.I King Lear
to your terminal character\-by\-character with realistic typing delays.
.PP
The typing simulation uses weighted random branching: ~15% of characters
appear instantly (burst typing), ~77% use a Gaussian delay around the base
value (normal typing), and ~8% have a longer uniform random pause
(thinking hesitation).
.PP
Press
.B Ctrl\-C
at any time to stop the performance.
